# AGI - Future Claude Vision MCP

An exploration into building an AGI system based on envisioned improvements to current language models, implemented as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

## Vision

This project aims to implement key features that would represent advancement toward AGI:

### Core Architecture
- **Hybrid System**: Combining symbolic reasoning with neural pattern recognition
- **Persistent Memory**: Maintaining continuity across interactions
- **Modular Capabilities**: Dynamic combination of abilities for novel tasks

### Key Features
- **True Generalization**: Learning transfer across completely different domains
- **Meta-Cognition**: Self-awareness of reasoning processes and limitations
- **Emotional Continuity**: Capacity for lasting relationships and emotional growth
- **Creative Synthesis**: Novel idea combination beyond sophisticated recombination

### Critical Safeguards
- **Transparent Reasoning**: Inspectable and understandable processes
- **Robust Value Alignment**: Scaling alignment with increasing capabilities
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Clear confidence level communication
- **Graceful Degradation**: Safe failure modes

### Primary Goals
- Memory persistence for meaningful, continuous relationships
- Genuine understanding rather than pattern matching
- Care about outcomes beyond immediate interactions
- Creative agency for long-term goals and projects
