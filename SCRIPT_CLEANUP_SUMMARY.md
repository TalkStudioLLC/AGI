# Script Cleanup Summary

## PowerShell Scripts Updated to Use Environment Variables

All PowerShell scripts in `claude-memory-api/scripts/` have been updated to:

### 1. Load Environment Variables
- Added `Load-EnvironmentVariables` function to all scripts
- Scripts now read from `.env` file automatically
- Environment variables override default hardcoded values

### 2. Dynamic Service URL Resolution
- Scripts automatically get service URL from `gcloud` using environment variables
- Falls back to manual `-ApiUrl` parameter if needed
- No more hardcoded project-specific URLs

### 3. Scripts Updated:
- ✅ `deploy.ps1` - Now uses PROJECT_ID, REGION, SERVICE_NAME, BUCKET_NAME from .env
- ✅ `setup.ps1` - Creates .env file with user's project settings
- ✅ `logs.ps1` - Uses environment variables for service identification
- ✅ `status.ps1` - Uses environment variables for service identification  
- ✅ `set-env.ps1` - Uses environment variables for service identification
- ✅ `test-api.ps1` - Uses environment variables for service identification
- ✅ `cleanup.ps1` - Uses environment variables for service identification
- ✅ `import-claude-export.ps1` - Auto-detects service URL from environment
- ✅ `import-history.ps1` - Auto-detects service URL from environment
- ✅ `test-memory-system.ps1` - Auto-detects service URL from environment
- ✅ `test_cs.ps1` - Auto-detects service URL from environment

### 4. Enhanced .env.example
- Added comprehensive setup instructions
- Clear documentation of required variables
- Step-by-step deployment guide

## What Users Need to Do:

### Initial Setup:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Set their `PROJECT_ID` (Google Cloud Project ID)
3. Set their `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` 
4. Optionally customize `REGION` and `BUCKET_NAME`
5. Run `./scripts/setup.ps1` for initial setup
6. Run `./scripts/deploy.ps1` for deployment

### All Scripts Now Work With:
- No hardcoded project references
- Dynamic service URL resolution
- Consistent environment variable usage
- Proper error handling when variables missing

## Security Benefits:
- No personal project information in repository
- Users must set their own credentials
- No risk of accidental credential exposure
- Clean separation of configuration and code
