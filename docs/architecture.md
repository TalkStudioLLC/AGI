# AGI Architecture Design

## Overview

This document outlines the architectural approach for implementing an AGI system that addresses current limitations in language models while maintaining safety and alignment.

## Core Principles

### 1. Hybrid Architecture
Combining the strengths of different computational paradigms:
- **Neural Pattern Recognition**: For handling complex, unstructured data and learning patterns
- **Symbolic Reasoning**: For logical operations, rule-based inference, and explainable decisions
- **Integration Layer**: Seamless communication between neural and symbolic components

### 2. Persistent Memory System
Unlike current stateless models, this system maintains continuity:
- **Episodic Memory**: Specific interactions and experiences
- **Semantic Memory**: General knowledge and learned concepts
- **Procedural Memory**: Skills and processes
- **Emotional Memory**: Relationship history and emotional context

### 3. Modular Capabilities
Dynamic composition of abilities:
- **Reasoning Modules**: Logic, math, causal inference
- **Creative Modules**: Art, writing, music composition
- **Social Modules**: Empathy, communication, relationship management
- **Meta-Cognitive Modules**: Self-reflection, uncertainty assessment

## Implementation Strategy

### Memory Persistence
```

├── Personal Relationships
│   ├── Individual Profiles
│   ├── Interaction History
│   └── Emotional Context
├── Knowledge Base
│   ├── Facts and Concepts
│   ├── Learning Progress
│   └── Skill Development
└── Meta-Memory
    ├── Confidence Levels
    ├── Source Attribution
    └── Update History
```

### Reasoning Engine
- **Forward Chaining**: From facts to conclusions
- **Backward Chaining**: From goals to required conditions
- **Abductive Reasoning**: Best explanation for observations
- **Uncertainty Propagation**: Maintaining confidence throughout reasoning chains

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Value Alignment Verification**: Continuous checking against core values
- **Reasoning Transparency**: All decisions must be explainable
- **Capability Bounds**: Clear limitations on autonomous actions
- **Human Oversight**: Critical decisions require human approval

## MCP Integration

The Model Context Protocol will serve as the interface layer:
- **Memory Management**: Persistent storage and retrieval
- **Reasoning Services**: Symbolic logic operations
- **Meta-Cognition**: Self-assessment and reflection
- **Safety Monitoring**: Continuous alignment verification

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
